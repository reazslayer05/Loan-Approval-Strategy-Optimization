![Loan Approval](https://img.shields.io/badge/Loan%20Approval%20Strategy%20Optimization-Ready%20to%20Explore-brightgreen)

## Overview

Welcome to the **Loan Approval Strategy Optimization** repository. This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or denied based on various applicant features and financial data. The insights gained from this analysis can help financial institutions make informed decisions, improve their approval processes, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately determines the likelihood of loan approval. By analyzing various features such as income, credit score, and loan amount, we aim to create a robust model that can assist lenders in their decision-making process.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a range of technologies and tools, including:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and model development.
- **Streamlit**: For building interactive web applications to showcase the model.
- **Tableau**: For creating insightful dashboards and visualizations.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Various algorithms will be employed for predictive modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore applicant features and financial data.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build and evaluate machine learning models.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Use Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface.
- **Visualizations**: Generate insights using Tableau dashboards.
- **Model Testing**: Validate the model's performance through rigorous testing.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reazslayer05/Loan-Approval-Strategy-Optimization.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Loan-Approval-Strategy-Optimization
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:

   It is recommended to create a virtual environment first. Then, install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server, and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Model Training and Evaluation

In this section, we detail the steps taken to train and evaluate the predictive model:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant features for the prediction task.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
4. **Training**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the models using the training set.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Visualization

Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the patterns and relationships within the dataset. We use Tableau to create interactive dashboards that provide insights into:

- Approval rates by income level.
- Distribution of credit scores among applicants.
- Correlation between loan amount and approval status.

## Testing

Testing is essential to ensure the reliability of the model. We implement unit tests and integration tests to validate the functionality of the application. 

Run the tests using the following command:

```bash
pytest
```
